# UFOs
## OVERVIEW
In this project we are going to create a webpage about UFO's sightings that includes a table to organize a Java Script array. The table will be fully dynamic and will be able to react to users input and filter data. Our resources are VSC,JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.

## RESULTS
This is the web app and it can initialized by clicking on the bar at the top left corner.

The unfiltered table starts like this.

To perform a search, the user just have to type any date, city, country, state or shape and press enter to filter the data and the table will display only the results that match the required values. For example, in the next image we just type "tx" to filter the UFO's sightseeing occured only in Texas and the table filter the rows only with the Texas value in City.

## SUMMARY
* One drawback of the HTML file is that the database is not too big, only includes sighthings of 2010 and in USA, also the user have to match the exact value for the search or it won't be display anything.

* To fix these inconvenients I would recommend to include a data range to be more flexible on the search input, also try to get a bigger JS array with more information, be more flexible on the input so it can accept lower and uppercase and change the CSS style, the website is kind of plain, maybe we can use a stripped table with  color variation.
